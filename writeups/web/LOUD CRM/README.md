# LOUD CRM
Author: blokli

## Description
```
Our new CRM platform SHOUTS EVERYTHING because the developer thought it would "improve readability."
Now every time I log in, it feels like someone is SCREAMING IN MY HEAD.
Alice from accounting has the flag. Maybe you can make the system stop yelling long enough to get in?
