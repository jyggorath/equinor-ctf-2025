Author: zledge

## Description
```
A rule conversion service bridges Sigma detections into KQL for a monitoring backend.
The developers have requested a pentest to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The application has already been provisioned to production, but we have the code to run it locally as well. Can you find any vulnerabilities in the application or its infrastructure?
