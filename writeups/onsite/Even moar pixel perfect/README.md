Author: surprior, nordbo

## Description
```
A great new feature just appeared on [https://pixelperfect.ept.gg/](https://pixelperfect.ept.gg/)

Click the play button and find our shiny new "Get flag!" feature. Read the instructions carefully, upload your script, and we'll run it for you.

Animations created this way will end up in a special priority queue and will be executed before normal animations.

Handout contains a service that can run locally to validate your scripts before uploading them to the main site.
