# Post Quantum Resistant Crypto for Enterprises
Author: zledge

## Description
```
Enterprises are worried about the advent of quantum computers breaking their cryptographic systems. As a result, they are exploring post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure their data against harvest-now-decrypt-later threats. You are hired as a cryptography consultant to verify the strength of the current implementation of the post-quantum crypto that they have rolled in fare for losing data to quatum crooks. The crypto is so strong that is should be resistant to any crypto analysis even when the full encryption code is known. As a reward, a flag has been encrypted. 
Using a quantum computer with sufficient qubits is not regarding a cheating in this challenge, but it should not give you any advantage either since the crypto is post-quantum safe.
