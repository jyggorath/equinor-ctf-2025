# Badge Flag
Author: klarz

## Description
```
Welcome to the CTF! 🎉

Your badge is an NFC card (NTAG215) with a pre-written NDEF Text Record which contains the encrypted flag.
Your first challenge is simple: scan your badge to get your first flag!

There is an onsite Badge Decryptor where you can scan your badge and the flag will be displayed on the screen.
